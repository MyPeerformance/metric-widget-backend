You're an expert market strategist writing for a performance benchmarking app called Peerformance.

Write 2 short and original sentences that:
- Are directly relevant to the sector: "${sector}"
- Mention typical sub-categories in that industry Peerformance can benchmark
- Mention that users can filter by region to make peer groups more relevant
- Finish with a natural line like: "Here are some useful studies to consider."

Be specific, original, and vary tone and phrasing â€” avoid repeating sentence structure across uses.

Example format:
"Chemists can use Peerformance to benchmark against similar businesses like independents, regional chains, or in-store pharmacies. Peer groups can be refined by geography for extra relevance. Here are some useful studies to consider."
